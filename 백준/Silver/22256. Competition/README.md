### 문제 설명

<p>You are Nilan, teaching a class of n students. Recently, each student sat for two examinations — Physics and Biology. The scores of the i-th student in Physics and Biology are denoted by A[i] and B[i] respectively. Each score is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10000, i.e. 0 ≤ A[i], B[i] ≤ 10000, ∀i ∈ [1, n].</p>

<p>Based on their results, you are to select a and b students to participate in the Physics and Biology categories of a Science competition respectively. To give all students a chance to represent their school, each student must be enrolled in exactly one of the categories.</p>

<p>Naturally, the school wants to maximise its chances of winning by sending the strongest team possible. This is achieved when the sum of Physics scores of the a Physics students combined with the sum of Biology scores of the b Biology students is maximised.</p>

<p>As their teacher, determine the maximum possible combined score of the Physics and Biology teams!</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Your program must read from standard input.</p>

<p>The first line of the input contains 3 integers n, a and b denoting the total number of students, the size of the Physics team and the size of the Biology team. It is guaranteed that a + b = n i.e. all students take part as either a Physics or a Biology competitor.</p>

<p>2 lines will follow. The first line contains n integers, i.e A[1], A[2], . . . , A[n]. The second line contains n integers, i.e B[1], B[2], . . . , B[n].</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Your program must print to standard output.</p>

<p>The output should contain a single integer on a single line, the maximum combined sum of all the Physics scores of the Physics team, and the Biology scores of the Biology team.</p>
